# Front End Engineer Exercise

I have created two different versions of the exercise in order to show different ways of resolving the same issue:

* One standalone file that only uses HTML5, CSS and basic JavaScript, no dependencies and no libraries. The goal of this test is to:
  - Focus on simplicity rather than complexity
  - Create a file that can be run and distributed easily
  - Focus on lightweight code (only 6kB!!!)
  - Demonstrate that a frameworks are optional and are not always needed
  - Best way to start testing and plying around with weather api.

* React + Bootstrap version of the same functionality (or almost the same). The aim of doing this version is:
  - Show my skills developing with a framework
  - React works perfect for this issue as it basicaly consists on rendering more than collecting data
  - Using a framework (specially React) we can extend the project with ease
  - we can create objects to render every entity which is 
  - more flexible than creating fixed structures
  - I selected Bootstrap only for CSS and components definitions
  - As Bootstrap requires jQuery I have used it to execute the AJAX request.

You can clone the project in local and open the html files in your favourite browser, or you can use these url from one of my hosted servers:
* Plain JS version: <http://www.pirchus.com/wipro/plain/plain_js.html>
* React+Bootstrap version: <http://www.pirchus.com/wipro/react/index.html>

I have enjoyed very much doing this exercise and I really hope you enjoy the results and our further discussion.

Thank you very much
